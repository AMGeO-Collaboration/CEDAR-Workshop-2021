Welcome to the AMGeO Workshop for CEDAR 2021!

## Workshop Link

To run the workshop materials on your own machine, we have provided a docker image of the notebooks and their dependencies!

[Once you have docker desktop installed](https://www.docker.com/get-started), you can pull the image by running

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/amgeo-collaboration/amgeo-cedar-workshop-2021
```

Once you have the image pulled, run

```bash
docker run -dp 8888:8888 ghcr.io/amgeo-collaboration/amgeo-cedar-workshop-2021
```

You will then be able to navigate to ```localhost:8888```, where you will enter ```test``` as a password. 

From here, you will seee ```CEDAR-WORKSHOP-2021```, which contains all of our notebooks that you can run on your own!

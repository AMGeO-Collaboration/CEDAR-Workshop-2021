The platform is made of the AMGeO open-source software and web application services that facilitate the data acquisition and pre-processing steps that are otherwise prohibitively labor-intensive. It is developed at the University of Colorado Boulder by the AMGeO Team, with support from the NSF Earth Cube program.\n",
